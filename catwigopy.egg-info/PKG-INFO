        ## Installation
        
        To install the latest version of [**catwigopy**](https://pypi.org/project/catwigopy/) from PyPi use:
        
        ``pip install catwigopy``
        
        All the dependencies are already listed on the setup file of the package, but to sum them up, you will need the following requirements:
        
        * [**pandas 0.24.2**](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
        * [**tweepy 3.7.0**](https://pypi.org/project/tweepy/)
        * [**numpy 1.16.2**](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
        
        
        **IMPORTANT**
        
        To use Catwigopy you need to create a [Twitter application](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/apps/overview), in order to  get the [acces tokens](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens.html) and connect with the Twitter API service.
        
        ## How to use it
        First of all, import the module
        
        ``from catwigopy import Catwigopy``
        
        This next line, creates an instance of Catwigopy for the specified user **username**.
        
        ``new_user = Catwigopy('Tesla', consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret)``
        
        Now you can display the user's name, username, image and description.
        
        ``new_user.get_user_name()``
        
        ``new_user.get_user_username()``
        
        ``new_user.get_user_image()``
        
        ``new_user.get_user_description()``
        
        You can also retrieve the hashtags terms count and the tweet terms count:
        
        ``res = new_user.get_hashtags_terms_count()``
        
        ``res = new_user.get_tweets_terms_count()``
        
        To retrieve the user timeline:
        
        ``new_user.search_user_timeline(number_of_tweets)``
        
        By default, number_of_tweets is 1200. You can decrease the value to get better execution times, but the prediction 
        accuracy will be penalized.
        
        Now, classify the tweets with the model and get the results in a dictionary with:
        
        ``res = new_user.get_user_classification()``
        
        ## Example results
        
        Here is the result of a simple Catwigopy use. **Here I only expose the top 3 categories** for each user, but all them are returned in the dictionary.
        
        | Username  | First Category | Second Category | Third Category |
        | ----- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
        | Tesla  | Automotive (70.92%)  | Software and Technology (10.07%) | Travel (3.86%)|
        | realDonaldTrump  | News and Politics (28.02%)  | Financial and Business (11.36%) | Sports (8.02%)|
        | sciencemagazine | Science (24.41%) | Medical Health (16.73%) |  Education (12.03%) |
        | NintendoAmerica | Videogames (41.65%) | Hobbies and Pop Culture (12.19%) | Sports (9.74%) |
