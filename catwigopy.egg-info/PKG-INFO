        ## Introduction
        
        **Catwigopy** is a tool which provides an easy way to generate a preferences profile of a given Twitter user.
        ## Installation
        
        To install the latest version of [**catwigopy**](https://pypi.org/project/catwigopy/) from PyPi use:
        
        ``pip install catwigopy``
        
        All the dependencies are already listed on the setup file of the package, but to sum them up, you will need the following requirements:
        
        * [**pandas 0.24.2**](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
        * [**tweepy 3.7.0**](https://pypi.org/project/tweepy/)
        * [**numpy 1.16.2**](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
        
        
        **IMPORTANT**
        
        To use Catwigopy you need to create a [Twitter application](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/apps/overview), in order to  get the [acces tokens](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens.html) and connect with the Twitter API service.
        
        ## How to use it
        First of all, import the module
        
        ``from catwigopy import Catwigopy``
        
        This next line, creates an instance of Catwigopy for the specified user **username**.
        
        ``new_user = Catwigopy('Tesla', consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret)``
        
        Now you can display the user's name, username, image and description.
        
        ``new_user.get_user_name()``
        
        ``new_user.get_user_username()``
        
        ``new_user.get_user_image()``
        
        ``new_user.get_user_description()``
        
        To retrive the user timeline:
        
        `new_user.search_user_timeline(number_of_tweets)`
        
        By default, number_of_tweets is 1200. You can decrease the value to get better execution times, but the prediction 
        accuracy will be penalized.
        
        Now, train the model and classify the tweets:
        
        ``new_user.classify_tweets_nmf()``
        
        And get the results in a dictionary:
        
        ``new_user.get_analysis_results()``
